# Internationalization

## Overview

CanvasLens has been fully internationalized to English to ensure better accessibility for the global developer community.

## What Was Converted

### Documentation Files
- ✅ `docs/LOGGING.md` - Logging system documentation
- ✅ `test/README.md` - Testing documentation
- ✅ `assets/js/README.md` - Navigation module documentation
- ✅ `assets/css/README.md` - CSS architecture documentation
- ✅ `CHANGELOG.md` - Project changelog

### Code Comments
- ✅ All code comments are already in English
- ✅ No Vietnamese text found in source code
- ✅ All variable names and function names follow English conventions

## Benefits

1. **Global Accessibility**: Documentation is now accessible to developers worldwide
2. **Professional Standards**: Follows industry best practices for open-source projects
3. **Better SEO**: English content improves search engine visibility
4. **Community Growth**: Easier for international contributors to understand and contribute
5. **Consistency**: All project documentation now uses a single language

## Language Policy

### Code
- All code, comments, and documentation must be in English
- Variable names, function names, and class names follow English conventions
- Error messages and user-facing text should be in English

### Documentation
- All README files must be in English
- API documentation must be in English
- Code examples and tutorials must be in English

### Contributing
- Issue reports should be in English
- Pull request descriptions should be in English
- Code reviews and discussions should be in English

## Future Considerations

### Multi-language Support
While the current focus is on English, future versions may include:
- Multi-language documentation using tools like Crowdin
- Localized error messages
- Language-specific examples

### Translation Guidelines
If translations are added in the future:
1. Maintain English as the primary language
2. Use professional translation services
3. Keep technical terms consistent across languages
4. Update translations with each release

## Verification

To ensure all content is in English:

```bash
# Check for Vietnamese characters in documentation
grep -r "[àáạảãâầấậẩẫăằắặẳẵèéẹẻẽêềếệểễìíịỉĩòóọỏõôồốộổỗơờớợởỡùúụủũưừứựửữỳýỵỷỹđ]" *.md docs/ test/ assets/

# Check for Vietnamese characters in source code
grep -r "[àáạảãâầấậẩẫăằắặẳẵèéẹẻẽêềếệểễìíịỉĩòóọỏõôồốộổỗơờớợởỡùúụủũưừứựửữỳýỵỷỹđ]" src/ scripts/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.js"
```

## Maintenance

- Regularly review new documentation to ensure it's in English
- Update this document when adding new language requirements
- Consider automated checks for language compliance in CI/CD pipeline
